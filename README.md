# Online-Addmission-System-for-NSTU
The main goal of this project is to introduce a paperless admission system. It also ensures smooth experience to the new students and administrative body by replicating NSTU admission process via a website. It saves half of work day of from traditional long queue system. 

Iâ€™ve done this project in my software engineering course in 6th semester.
